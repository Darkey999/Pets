I created this app as a part of Udacity scholarship for Android, to improve my skill in XML, Java and SQLite.

App gives the user options, such as: adding pet, updating pet, deleting single pet and deleting all pets from the database.

Creating this app improved my skills in using Menu and MenuItems, creating Dialogs(they are helpful, when we must work carefully
with data), SQLite, mechanisms used for(or helping with) processing data(such as Contract, ContentProvider, SQLiteOpenHelper, Loader) and
operating on databases(CRUD).
